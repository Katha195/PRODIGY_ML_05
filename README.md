In this repository I have developed a model that can recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content, enabling users to track their dietary intake and make informed food choices.

Here the user have to give the food item of their choice as input and this ML model will recognize it and as an output it will track the dietary intake.

In this repository the dataset which has been used is taken from:
